# 502 Bad Gateway Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The GaadiMech CRM application was experiencing 502 Bad Gateway errors on AWS deployment while working fine locally.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. APScheduler in Multi-Instance Environment
- **Issue**: APScheduler was running on AWS which typically has multiple instances
- **Problem**: Background schedulers aren't designed for multi-instance environments without coordination
- **Solution**: Removed APScheduler entirely and commented out scheduler setup

### 2. Problematic Imports
- **Issue**: `from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo` not available in AWS Python runtime
- **Solution**: Removed import and used pytz exclusively for timezone handling

### 3. Complex Database Connection Logic
- **Issue**: Complex psycopg version detection logic was failing during startup
- **Solution**: Simplified to use psycopg2-binary which is specified in requirements.txt

### 4. HTTPS Redirect Loop
- **Issue**: `@application.before_request` function forcing HTTPS was causing redirect loops
- **Solution**: Removed the force_https function entirely

### 5. Session Cookie Configuration
- **Issue**: HTTPS-only cookie settings causing issues with AWS ALB
- **Solution**: Set SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE and REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE to False

### 6. Port Configuration
- **Issue**: Using port 3030 which might not be compatible with AWS
- **Solution**: Changed default port to 5000 for better AWS compatibility

## Files Modified

### 1. application.py
- Removed zoneinfo import
- Removed APScheduler imports and setup
- Simplified database connection logic
- Removed HTTPS redirect function
- Fixed session cookie settings
- Changed default port to 5000
- Removed scheduler initialization in main block

### 2. requirements.txt
- Removed APScheduler==3.11.0 package

## Deployment Package
- Created `deploy_502_fix/` directory with fixed files
- Generated `gaadimech-crm-502-fix.zip` for deployment

## Key Changes Made

```python
# REMOVED: Problematic imports
# from zoneinfo import ZoneInfo
# from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
# from apscheduler.triggers.cron import CronTrigger
# import atexit

# SIMPLIFIED: Database connection
DATABASE_URL = f"postgresql+psycopg2://{RDS_USER}:{RDS_PASSWORD}@{RDS_HOST}:{RDS_PORT}/{RDS_DB}"

# FIXED: Session cookies for AWS ALB
SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=False
REMEMBER_COOKIE_SECURE=False

# REMOVED: HTTPS redirect that caused loops
# @application.before_request
# def force_https():

# DISABLED: Scheduler setup
# def setup_scheduler():

# CHANGED: Port configuration
port = int(os.environ.get('PORT', 5000))
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Local Testing**: Verify the application still works locally after changes
2. **Database Connection**: Test database connectivity with simplified connection logic
3. **Health Checks**: Use `/health` and `/health-check` endpoints to verify AWS deployment
4. **Functionality**: Test core CRM functionality (login, dashboard, leads, followups)

## Manual Snapshot Trigger
Since APScheduler is disabled, the daily snapshot can be triggered manually via:
- Admin users can call `/api/trigger-snapshot` endpoint
- Consider setting up AWS Lambda for scheduled tasks if needed

## Next Steps
1. Deploy the fixed package (`gaadimech-crm-502-fix.zip`) to AWS
2. Monitor AWS logs for any remaining issues
3. Test all functionality in production environment
4. Set up external cron job or AWS Lambda for daily snapshots if required

## Monitoring
- Check AWS CloudWatch logs for application startup
- Monitor `/health-check` endpoint for database connectivity
- Verify no more 502 errors in AWS ALB logs
